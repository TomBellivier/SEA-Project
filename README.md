# SEA : Simulation d'écosystème aléatoire
Random Ecosystem Simulation

The code is mostly in french.

There is 2 versions of the project :
- version V1.0 which includes first version of neural network for Otus' brain
- version V1.1, which includes improved ui and more action to interact with the simulation.

Controls :
- return : show the influence of the inputs on outputs of the selectioned Otus' brain.
- space : artificialy mutate the selected otus' brain
- tab : show/hide selected Otus' informations
- scroll : zoom in / zoom out
- left click : select an Otus
- escape : reinitialize zoom
- f : enter follow mode (follow an Otus during its trip)

To Lauch the project, you need to download the whole repository, then modify the "main.py" to specify which version the program will launch (1.0 or 1.1). Then just run the script and let a beautiful world appear in front of your eyes !
